# TODO - fix some bugs / issues

1. Ports need to be opened ahead of time - how to do this? 

  ```
  browseVignette('dplyr')
  ```
  
  this will fail
  
  But, if I actually open the link on a browser, github is able to connect to it.
  
  ```
  browseVignette('dplyr')
  ```
  
2. Customize view for people lauching

  - Launches with Darkmode
  - Launches with Jupyter code as first page on opening
